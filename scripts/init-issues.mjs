    title: '[1a] Set up pipeline secrets and variables',
    body: `## Summary

Configure CI/CD pipeline secrets and repository variables so automated workflows can build and deploy the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Repository **Variables** added (Settings → Secrets and variables → Variables):
  - \`OCIR_REGISTRY\` — e.g. \`lhr.ocir.io\`
  - \`OCIR_NAMESPACE\` — your OCI tenancy namespace
- [ ] Repository **Secrets** added (Settings → Secrets and variables → Secrets):
  - \`OCIR_USERNAME\` — e.g. \`tenancy/oracleidentitycloudservice/your@email.com\`
  - \`OCIR_AUTH_TOKEN\` — OCI auth token

## AI Notes

This issue is actioned by the developer, not the AI. Close it once secrets are configured.

  {
    title: '[1b] Set up branch policies',
    body: `## Summary

Configure branch protection rules so that \`main\` is developer-only and all agent work flows through \`dev\` via PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] \`main\` branch created and protected (require PR, no direct push)
- [ ] \`dev\` branch created — default branch for agent PRs
- [ ] **"Automatically delete head branches"** enabled (Settings → General)

## AI Notes

This issue is actioned by the developer. Close it once branch policies are in place.

    title: '[1c] Define high-level project spec, vision and external dependencies',
    body: `## Summary

Capture the product vision and scope so the AI can produce the first spec PR — covering epics, features, and external dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Spec questionnaire completed (see below)
- [ ] \`ai-ready\` label applied to this issue
- [ ] AI raises a spec PR with vision statement, \`docs/epics/\`, \`docs/features/\`, and dependency notes
- [ ] All ambiguities resolved via PR comments or \`needs-input\` issues
- [ ] Spec PR reviewed and merged by developer

## Spec Questionnaire

Please answer the following, then add the \`ai-ready\` label:

- **What problem does this product solve, and for whom?**

- **What does a successful MVP look like?**

- **Is Postgres required?** If so, any schema or domain hints?

- **Any external data sources, APIs, or third-party integrations?**

- **Any auth providers, payment gateways, or other dependencies?**

- **What is explicitly out of scope for the MVP?**

## AI Notes

When this issue is labelled \`ai-ready\`:
1. Read the questionnaire answers above
2. Raise a spec PR containing: vision statement, \`docs/epics/*.md\`, \`docs/features/*.md\`, out-of-scope list, and external dependency notes
3. Leave a PR comment for anything ambiguous — if unresolved after one round, open a \`needs-input\` issue

**Open UX questions to resolve:**
- <question from feature file>
- <question from feature file>

**Deliverables (in the design PR):**
- [ ] ASCII mockup for each meaningful page/component state
- [ ] ASCII mockup for each key interaction state (loading, error, empty)
- [ ] Mermaid workflow diagram for each key user action
- [ ] All open UX questions answered
\`\`\`
